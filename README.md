## Steps to approach a coding problem:
1. Listen and ask clarifying questions
2. Think of a big and general example (not trivial) - think of edge cases too!
3. Come up with brute force algorithm
4. To optimize - remove bottlenecks (steps that take extra time/space) and duplicated steps
5. Start coding - modularize parts
6. Test code (dry run) on an example
