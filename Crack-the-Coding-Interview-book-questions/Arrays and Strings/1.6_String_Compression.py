# Implement a method to perform basic string compression using the counts
# of repeated characters. For example, the string aabcccccaaa would become a2blc5a3. If the
# "compressed" string would not become smaller than the original string, your method should return
# the original string. You can assume the string has only uppercase and lowercase letters (a - z).

            countConsecutive = 0
